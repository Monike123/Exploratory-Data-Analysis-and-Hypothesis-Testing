# Mission Success: Exploratory Data Analysis and Hypothesis Testing


Overview:
This repository explores trends in space missions by performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Hypothesis Testing on a dataset related to real-time space missions, available from Kaggle. The dataset offers valuable insights into mission success rates, rocket costs, and other key factors impacting space exploration.

Dataset Overview:
Link : [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhijitdahatonde/real-time-space-mission-dataset](url)
The dataset includes information on space missions from various organizations, detailing rocket types, mission outcomes, launch times, and more. Key fields:

Company: Space organization conducting the mission.

Location: Launch location.

Date & Time: Launch date and time (UTC).

Rocket: Rocket name used.

Mission: Name of the space mission.

RocketStatus: Active or Inactive status of the rocket.

Price: Cost of the rocket in millions of dollars.

MissionStatus: Outcome (Success/Failure).


Objectives:
The primary objective is to uncover patterns in mission outcomes, including:
Success vs. failure rates across space agencies.
Correlation between rocket costs and mission success.
Trends in rocket reusability and lifespan.
By using statistical analysis, this project will provide insights into the efficiency and challenges faced by space exploration companies.
